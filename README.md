# SME-Wrangling-and-Analysis

During my time at BCG, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset consisting of 600K SMEs in Vietnam. Uploaded is an R script in which I wrangled the data and merged with relevant sources to create an informative dataset that helps guide my teammates devise strategies for our banking client's sales model development.

By leveraging R, I have reduced the analysis time by half (from the initially expected 5 days to only 2.5 days), allowing my teammates to quickly complete the relevant part of the strategy deliverable before client presentation.
